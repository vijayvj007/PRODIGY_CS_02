# Simple Image Encryption Tool

This project is a simple image encryption tool that utilizes pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt and decrypt images. Users can perform operations such as swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel to achieve encryption.

## Features

- Encrypt images by manipulating pixel values.
- Decrypt images by reversing the pixel manipulation process.
- Supports common image formats such as PNG and JPEG.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

 
## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

## Acknowledgments

- This tool is inspired by basic principles of image processing and encryption techniques. Special thanks to the developers of the `Pillow` library for making image manipulation in Python straightforward and efficient.
